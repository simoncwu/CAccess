<h2>@ViewBag.Title</h2>
<p>A campaign submits a Candidacy Termination if it has ceased all campaigning, and wishes to terminate a candidacy. By filing this form, your campaign will be relieved of its obligation to file disclosure statements with the CFB, even if you continue to be on the ballot for the election. Your campaign remains subject to all other requirements, however, including recordkeeping, responding to CFB requests, an audit of your campaign finances, and paying penalties for violations of CFB requirements.</p>
<p>The CFB on its own may determine that a candidacy is terminated if you did not file ballot petitions, or you filed ballot petitions but were disqualified (and a court has not reversed the disqualification).</p>
<p>Listed below is the history of all Candidacy Terminations, resubmissions of Candidacy Terminations, and amendments to Candidacy Terminations received by the CFB from your campaign. A &ldquo;Processing&rdquo; status does not indicate that your Candidacy Termination Form has been &ldquo;Accepted&rdquo; by the CFB.</p>
