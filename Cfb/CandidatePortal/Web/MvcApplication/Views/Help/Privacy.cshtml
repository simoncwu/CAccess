<p>The privacy and confidentiality of a candidate&rsquo;s campaign is very important to the CFB. Our concern for your privacy extends to use of @appName. That view underlies our policy, stated below:</p>
<p>@appName will only provide information specific to the campaign of that logged in user. Information specific to another candidate&rsquo;s campaign will not be provided. Only CFB staff and the campaign have access to that campaign&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We do not give, sell, or transfer any personal information to third parties.</li>
    <li>We store a temporary &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; solely for tracking your logged-in status throughout the course of a single @appName session. This cookie expires upon the end of your visit and does not monitor any browsing activity outside of @appName. (A &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; is a file placed on your hard drive by a Web site that allows it to monitor your use of the site.)</li>
    <li>Information is collected for statistical purposes and we occasionally analyze user behavior to measure customer interest in the various areas of our site.</li>
</ul>
